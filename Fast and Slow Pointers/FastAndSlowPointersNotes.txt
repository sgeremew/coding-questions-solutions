/**
Identify if repeatedly computing the sum of squares of the digits of number 19 results in 1

n=19

1^2 + 9^2 = 1+3 = 4
4^2 = 16
1^2 + 6^2 = 1 + 36 = 37
3^2 + 7^2 = 9 + 49 = 58
5^2 + 8^2 = 25 + 64 = 89****
72 + 81 = 153
1 + 25 + 9 = 35
9 + 25 = 34
9 + 16 = 25
4 + 25 = 29
4 + 81 = 85
64 + 25 = 89**** a cycle -> stop here

You can use Fast and Slow pointers approach to solve this sum of squares question.
