Greedy Algorithm

- optimization problems
- solves problem piece by piece recursively
- chooses locally optimal solution
- lacks context of bigger picture
- may complete with a non-optimal solution

example problems
traveling salesman, Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm, Social networking websites (recommend friends using Dijkstra algo for shortest path between user connections)
